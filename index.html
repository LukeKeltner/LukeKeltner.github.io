							<p>I’m currently on my 4th cup of coffee as I write this. That might sound like a bit much but it only means that I must not be sleeping at the moment.  I’m not sure what the World Wildlife Federation would classify me as if all coffee suddenly disappeared from the face of the Earth but I’m assuming I would be in a similar class a Gollum, the once-elf who has decided to spend eternity in a mountain.</p>

							<p>I do like Lord of the Rings but I'm a much bigger Harry Potter fan.  I find it suspicious that if there is a God, she would have decided to create reality the way it is, then create someone in this reality who can conceive of a much better one and not be self conscious about it.  Of course, it could just be that J. K. Rowling <span>is</span> God...that makes the most sense to me right now.</p>

							<p>Besides coffee and Harry Potter, I think my two other most favorite things in the world are haircuts and Skyline Chili. Now, to be fair, I was not a fan of Skyline Chili for the first ten or so times I had it.  My father was obsessed with it when I was a child so he kept feeding it to me.  However, one  day everything clicked and I could not get enough.  I still have cravings for it...like <span>intense</span> cravings. Writing this is making another one happen now.</p>

							<p>Maybe I should finish off this rambling with who I am.  I have a PhD in Theoretical Physics where I studied a new mechanism for potentially quantizing General Relativity which involves gravitons scattering off themselves in a nonlocal and quasi noncausal manner.  I currently teach physics at a local private high school and very much am enjoying to learn how to code!</p>
